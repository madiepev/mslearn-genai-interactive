**User**: How do I implement error handling in a REST API using Express.js?

**AI**: Here's how to implement comprehensive error handling in an Express.js REST API:

## Global Error Handler
```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    error: {
      message: err.message,
      status: err.status || 500
    }
  });
});
```

Would you like me to explain specific error types or show you how to create custom error classes?
