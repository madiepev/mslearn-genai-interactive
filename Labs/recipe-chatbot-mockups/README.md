# Recipe chatbot evaluation exercise

Learn AI evaluation methodologies through hands-on tasks focused on a farm business recipe chatbot scenario.

## Scenario

**Farm business recipe chatbot**  
You're helping evaluate an AI chatbot for Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm that assists customers with recipe recommendations, meal planning, and cooking guidance using farm products.

**Your role:** AI evaluation specialist responsible for ensuring the chatbot meets customer needs and business objectives.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Identify user needs
Determine the most critical requirements for the recipe chatbot system

> **Your task:** As an AI evaluation specialist, you need to establish the core requirements for Munson's Farm recipe chatbot by analyzing potential user needs and selecting the three most critical ones that will drive the chatbot's development. You'll evaluate nine different user needs and identify which ones are essential for helping customers discover recipes, plan meals, and get cooking guidance using farm products.

**Method:** Multiple choice selection from 9 potential user needs  
**Success criteria:** Identify the 3 most critical needs: recipe search & discovery, meal planning, and cooking tips & techniques  

### Task 2: Evaluate response quality
Compare AI responses to select higher quality options across customer scenarios

> **Your task:** You'll act as a quality assessor to evaluate different AI chatbot responses by comparing them side-by-side across three realistic customer scenarios. For each scenario, you need to analyze two potential responses and select the one that provides more specific, actionable guidance that directly addresses the customer's situation and needs.

**Method:** A/B comparison across 3 customer scenarios  
**Success criteria:** Choose responses that are specific, actionable, and directly address customer situations  

### Task 3: Select evaluation metrics
Choose appropriate Azure AI Foundry metrics for comprehensive chatbot assessment

> **Your task:** You need to select the most appropriate evaluation metrics from Azure AI Foundry's toolkit to ensure the recipe chatbot meets both quality and safety standards. From six available metrics spanning AI Quality and Risk & Safety categories, you'll choose three that will provide comprehensive assessment of the chatbot's performance in the farm business context.

**Method:** Select 3 metrics from 6 Azure AI Foundry options across AI Quality and Risk & Safety categories  
**Success criteria:** Select groundedness, relevance, and harmful content detection metrics  

### Task 4: Create a smoke test set
Design a focused test set for initial chatbot validation using real customer data

> **Your task:** You'll create a balanced smoke test set by selecting three diverse conversations from historical customer data that will effectively validate the chatbot's core functionality. Your selections need to cover different conversation types, complexity levels, and customer intents to ensure comprehensive initial testing of the recipe chatbot before full deployment.

**Method:** Select 3 diverse conversations from historical customer data  
**Success criteria:** Achieve balanced coverage across conversation types, complexity levels, and customer intents  

### Task 5: Manual ACRUE evaluation
Apply structured manual evaluation using the comprehensive ACRUE framework

> **Your task:** You'll conduct a thorough manual evaluation of AI responses using the ACRUE framework (Accurate, Complete, Relevant, Useful, Exceptional). For two different AI responses, you need to rate each one across all five dimensions using a 1-5 scale, providing detailed assessment of how well the chatbot performs in real customer interaction scenarios.

**Method:** Rate 2 AI responses across 5 dimensions (Accurate, Complete, Relevant, Useful, Exceptional) on 1-5 scales  
**Success criteria:** Complete evaluation with ratings within ±1 of expert assessments
