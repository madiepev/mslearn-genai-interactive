# Define agent specifications for GenAIOps planning
Learn systematic approaches to planning AI agent solutions by analyzing user needs, designing effective prompts, and creating comprehensive testing strategies.

## Scenario

**Outdoor Adventures Inc.** is a leading outdoor gear retailer with a frustrating problem: customers who love the outdoors struggle to choose the right gear. Picture Sarah, who spent three hours browsing hiking boots online, adding and removing items from her cart, only to abandon her purchase entirely. She's not alone—this scenario plays out hundreds of times daily.

The company faces three critical challenges:
- **Purchase abandonment**: Overwhelmed customers leave without buying anything
- **Wrong gear purchases**: Uninformed decisions lead to returns and negative reviews  
- **Online shopping barriers**: Most customers prefer online shopping but miss the guidance that in-store staff provide

Here's the strategic opportunity: instead of starting with gear selection, what if you helped customers discover amazing hiking trails first? This approach serves a dual purpose—it engages customers who aren't yet aware they need new gear while naturally revealing what equipment their chosen adventures actually require.

The company needs an AI assistant that transforms confused browsers into confident buyers by building their outdoor knowledge and connecting their hiking dreams to the right gear.

**Your role:** GenAIOps engineer responsible for defining the specifications for this trail discovery assistant. Your goal is to create an AI solution that strategically guides customers from inspiration ("I want to explore!") to informed purchases ("I need these specific items for my adventure"), solving the core problem of customer indecision through education and engagement.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Analyze user intent and target audience
Identify the two complementary user intents that build customer confidence while strategically leading to gear recommendations

> **Your task:** Select two complementary user intents from nine options that work together to solve the core business challenge. Choose one trail-focused intent to engage and educate customers, and one gear-focused intent to convert that engagement into confident purchases. Your selections should reduce customer indecision and improve purchase satisfaction.

**Method:** Select 2 complementary user intents from 9 options: one trail-focused intent and one gear-focused intent that work together strategically  
**Feedback opportunity:** Feedback will explain why certain user intent combinations work better together than others, helping you understand how to design AI experiences that guide customers through strategic journeys without feeling manipulative  

### Task 2: Design effective prompts
Create optimal prompt strategies that guide customers from trail discovery to confident gear selection

> **Your task:** Design and evaluate prompt strategies that support the customer journey from trail discovery to gear recommendations. Analyze different prompt approaches and select those that build customer confidence and naturally introduce gear needs without feeling sales-focused. Consider how prompts can educate customers while guiding them toward informed purchase decisions.

**Method:** Compare prompt strategies that balance engagement, education, and strategic business outcomes across the customer journey  
**Feedback opportunity:** Feedback will explain why specific prompt techniques are more effective at building customer trust and confidence, showing you how subtle wording changes can dramatically impact user perception and conversion outcomes  

### Task 3: Define agent capabilities
Determine essential tools, databases, and APIs that enable the strategic journey from trail discovery to gear recommendations

> **Your task:** Specify what capabilities the Trail Guide AI Assistant needs to guide customers from trail discovery to confident gear purchases. Select essential integrations from trail databases, gear catalogs, customer profiling systems, and review platforms that enable personalized recommendations and reduce purchase indecision. Focus on connecting trail characteristics to appropriate gear needs.

**Method:** Select essential capabilities from categories including geospatial databases, gear inventory systems, customer preference tracking, and review management tools, with strategic business impact considerations  
**Feedback opportunity:** Feedback will explain why certain technical capabilities are more valuable than others for your business strategy, helping you understand how to evaluate technology choices based on customer impact rather than technical sophistication  

### Task 4: Optimize response quality
Select quality metrics and design response formats that build customer confidence and drive appropriate gear purchases

> **Your task:** Determine the most important quality metric for evaluating AI responses and design an optimal response format. Choose from quality dimensions like accuracy, completeness, relevance, and helpfulness to identify what's most critical for building customer confidence in gear choices. Then design a response structure that maximizes performance while connecting trail recommendations to gear suggestions.

**Method:** Prioritize quality metrics based on customer confidence and purchase satisfaction data, and design response templates that educate while strategically guiding toward gear decisions  
**Feedback opportunity:** Feedback will explain why different quality metrics matter for different business outcomes, teaching you how to choose metrics that actually predict customer satisfaction and business success rather than just technical performance  

### Task 5: Create smoke test suite
Develop comprehensive test prompts that validate the trail-to-gear customer journey and confidence building

> **Your task:** Create three test prompts representing different customer experience levels and gear awareness that all lead to confident gear selection. Design tests that validate the agent's ability to meet customers at different starting points—from complete beginners to experienced hikers—and ensure consistent confidence building and appropriate recommendations across all experience levels.

**Method:** Design 3 diverse test prompts representing different customer experience levels and gear awareness, all leading to the same strategic outcome of confident gear selection  
**Feedback opportunity:** Feedback will explain why comprehensive testing across user personas is critical for AI success, showing you how to design test cases that reveal potential failure points before they impact real customers  

## Exercise information

**Format:** Interactive scenario-based exercises with guided decision-making and business impact analysis  
**Duration:** 30-35 minutes  
**Flow:** Complete tasks sequentially as each builds on previous decisions. Task outputs will inform the agent specification document that guides development priorities and sales impact measurement.
