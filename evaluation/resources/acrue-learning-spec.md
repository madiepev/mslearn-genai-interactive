# ACRUE Learning Experience â€” Specification

Purpose: Teach practitioners how to apply the ACRUE measurement approach (Accurate, Complete, Relevant, Useful, Exceptional) to evaluate Copilot or similar AI response quality in-context.

**Design Constraint: All learning objectives, activities, and assessments must use close-ended tasks that can be objectively evaluated. Open-ended creative tasks (e.g., "write clear statements") are replaced with selection, classification, or structured comparison tasks (e.g., "select the clearest statements from provided options").**

## Target audience
- UX researchers, product managers, and data analysts working on AI assistants (Copilot-like experiences).
- Product designers and engineers responsible for feedback collection and telemetry instrumentation.
- Research operations and QA engineers who will implement or validate ACRUE in product or studies.
- Basic prerequisites: familiarity with UX research concepts, Likert scales, and basic statistics (mean, distribution, simple hypothesis testing).

## Learning objectives (measurable)
By the end of this learning experience learners will be able to:
1. Explain the ACRUE framework and why in-context user perception matters (Knowledge).
2. Distinguish between Scale ACRUE and Frequency ACRUE and select the appropriate approach for a given context (Comprehension & Decision-making).
3. **Select and rank clear, user-facing ACRUE statements from provided options** that avoid technical labels and are appropriate for in-context collection (Application).
4. **Choose optimal survey flow components from a menu of options** to create a brief ACRUE feedback UI that fits within a product interaction and minimizes friction (Design skill).
5. **Follow structured analysis steps** to run a small ACRUE pilot, analyze provided results using guided templates, and **select appropriate recommendations from categorized options** (Analysis & Synthesis).
6. **Apply provided rubrics** to interpret ACRUE scores and **match scores to pre-defined recommendation categories** (Evaluation).
