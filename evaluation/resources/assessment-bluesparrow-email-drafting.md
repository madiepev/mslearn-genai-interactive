# Summative Assessment: ACRUE for Email Drafting

Fictional company: BlueSparrow Media
Use case: Drafting external client-facing emails that must respect corporate tone and regulatory disclaimers.

Timebox: 30–45 minutes (closed assessment)

Assessment overview
- You will receive a small dataset of mock feedback for email drafts generated by a Copilot-style assistant.
- Tasks: (1) write five Scale ACRUE statements tailored to email drafting, (2) analyze the provided dataset (compute means and one cross-tab), and (3) submit a concise findings paragraph (≤ 300 words) and two prioritized recommendations.
- The assessment uses a different company and job than the hands-on activity to evaluate transfer of learning.

Materials included (in this file)
- Small mock dataset (20 rows) with simulated ratings for the five ACRUE elements.

Assessment tasks (step-by-step)
1. Draft five Scale ACRUE statements for email-drafting that are plain-language and in-context (5–10 minutes).
2. Load or paste the dataset into a spreadsheet or small analysis tool.
3. Compute the mean score for each ACRUE element across the dataset. (5–10 minutes)
4. Compute one cross-tab: for example, compare Usefulness (U) mean for emails with low Completeness (C ≤ 2) vs high Completeness (C ≥ 4). (5–10 minutes)
5. Write a concise findings paragraph (≤ 300 words) that summarizes the key results, the most pressing problems, and two prioritized recommendations (10–15 minutes).

Submission requirements
- Five ACRUE statements (text)
- A short table or screenshot showing the computed means and the chosen cross-tab
- A ≤ 300-word findings paragraph and two prioritized recommendations

Scoring rubric (compact)
- Instrument clarity (30 pts): Five clear, non-technical statements mapped to ACRUE elements.
- Quick analysis (40 pts): Means correctly computed and one reasonable cross-tab produced and interpreted.
- Findings & recommendations (30 pts): Clear, actionable interpretation with prioritized recommendations.

Passing score: ≥ 80 pts

Notes for graders
- Focus on whether the learner can transfer the ACRUE approach from the guided meeting summarization exercises to an email-drafting scenario with different constraints (tone, legal clauses).
- Check for calculation correctness and whether recommendations are defensible given the dataset.

Good luck — you have 30–45 minutes.
